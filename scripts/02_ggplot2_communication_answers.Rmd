"The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst's mind than any other device." --- John Tukey

## Introduction

For publishing purposes, you need to *communicate* your understanding to others. Your audience will likely not share your background knowledge and will not be deeply invested in the data. To help others quickly build up a good mental model of the data, you will need to invest considerable effort in making your plots as self-explanatory as possible. In this chapter, you'll learn some of the tools that `ggplot2` provides to do so.

This chapter focuses on the tools you need to create good graphics. We assume that you know what you want, and just need to know how to do it.

### Prerequisites

In this chapter, we'll focus once again on `ggplot2`. We'll also use a little **dplyr** for data manipulation, **scales** to override the default breaks, labels, transformations and palettes, and a few `ggplot2` extension packages, including **ggrepel** ([https://ggrepel.slowkow.com](https://ggrepel.slowkow.com/)) by Kamil Slowikowski and **patchwork** ([https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/)) by Thomas Lin Pedersen.

First load the packages 'tidyverse', 'ggrepel', `patchwork`, `ggthemes` and 
`scales`:

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(ggrepel)
library(patchwork)
library(ggthemes)
library(scales)
```

## Labels

The easiest place to start when turning an exploratory graphic into an expository graphic is with good labels. You add labels with the `labs()` function, it's a little bit easier to use than `theme()` because it's designed to work with the `aes()` function.

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  labs(
    x = "Engine displacement (L)",
    y = "Highway fuel economy (mpg)",
    color = "Car type",
    title = "Fuel efficiency generally decreases with engine size",
    subtitle = "Two seaters (sports cars) are an exception because 
    of their light weight",
    caption = "Data from fueleconomy.gov"
  )
```

The purpose of a plot title is to summarize the main finding.
Avoid titles that just describe what the plot is, e.g., "A scatterplot of engine displacement vs. fuel economy".

If you need to add more text, there are two other useful labels: `subtitle` adds additional detail in a smaller font beneath the title and `caption` adds text at the bottom right of the plot, often used to describe the source of the data.

You can also use `labs()` to replace the axis and legend titles. Note the replacement of the legend title by "Car type" in the previous plot. It's usually a good idea to replace short variable names with more detailed descriptions, and to include the units.

It's possible to use mathematical equations instead of text strings.
Just switch `""` out for `quote()` and read about the available options in `?plotmath`:

```{r, fig.asp = 1, out.width = "50%", fig.width = 3}


df <- tibble(x = 1:10,
             y = cumsum(x ^ 2))

ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = quote(x[i]),
       y = quote(sum(x[i] ^ 2, i == 1, n)))
```

  )
```

## Annotations

In addition to labeling major components of your plot, it's often useful to label individual observations or groups of observations. The first tool you have at your disposal is `geom_text()`. `geom_text()` is similar to `geom_point()`, but it has an additional aesthetic: `label`. This makes it possible to add textual labels to your plots.

There are two possible sources of labels. First, you might have a tibble that provides labels. In the following plot we pull out the cars with the highest engine size in each drive type and save their information as a new data frame called `label_info`.

`slice_head()` is a useful function from the **dplyr** package that allows you to select the first `n` rows of a data frame so when n = 1 it means the right-most point for each drive type.

`case_when()` is a function that allows you to specify multiple conditions and their corresponding values in a single line of code. It's a more readable and concise way to write multiple `if_else()` statements.

```{r}

label_info <- mpg |>
  group_by(drv) |>
  arrange(desc(displ)) |>
  slice_head(n = 1) |>
  mutate(
    drive_type = case_when(
      drv == "f" ~ "front-wheel drive",
      drv == "r" ~ "rear-wheel drive",
      drv == "4" ~ "4-wheel drive"
    )
  ) |> select(displ, hwy, drv, drive_type)

```

**Notice that `displ` values in `label_info` have captured the right-most point for each drive type.**
Then, we use this new data frame to directly label the three groups to replace the legend with labels placed directly on the plot. Using the `fontface` and `size` arguments we can customize the look of the text labels.

They're larger than the rest of the text on the plot and bolded.
(`theme(legend.position = "none"`) turns all the legends off --- we'll talk about it more shortly.)

```{r}

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  geom_text(
    data = label_info,
    aes(x = displ, y = hwy, label = drive_type),
    fontface = "bold",
    size = 5,
    hjust = "right",
    vjust = "bottom"
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
**Once you see the placement you can use `nudge_x` and `nudge_y` to set it so that it doesn't overlap.**

Note the use of `hjust` (horizontal justification) and `vjust` (vertical justification) to control the alignment of the label.

However the annotated plot we made above is hard to read because the labels overlap with each other, and with the points.

We can use the `geom_label_repel()` function from the ggrepel package to address both of these issues. This useful package will automatically adjust labels so that they don't overlap:

```{r}

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  geom_label_repel(
    data = label_info,
    aes(x = displ, y = hwy, label = drive_type),
    fontface = "bold",
    size = 5,
    nudge_y = 2
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

You can also use the same idea to highlight certain points on a plot with `geom_text_repel()` from the ggrepel package.
Note another handy technique used here: we added a second layer of large, hollow points to further highlight the labelled points.

```{r}

potential_outliers <- mpg |>
  filter(hwy > 40 | (hwy > 20 & displ > 5))

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text_repel(data = potential_outliers, aes(label = model)) +
  geom_point(data = potential_outliers, color = "red") +
  geom_point(
    data = potential_outliers,
    color = "red", size = 3, shape = "circle open"
  )
```

Remember, in addition to `geom_text()` and `geom_label()`, you have many other `geoms` in `ggplot2` available to help annotate your plot.
A couple ideas:

-   Use `geom_hline()` and `geom_vline()` to add reference lines.
    We often make them thick (`linewidth = 2`) and white (`color = white`), and draw them underneath the primary data layer.
    That makes them easy to see, without drawing attention away from the data.

-   Use `geom_rect()` to draw a rectangle around points of interest.
    The boundaries of the rectangle are defined by aesthetics `xmin`, `xmax`, `ymin`, `ymax`.

-   Use `geom_segment()` with the `arrow` argument to draw attention to a point with an arrow.
    Use aesthetics `x` and `y` to define the starting location, and `xend` and `yend` to define the end location.

Another handy function for adding annotations to plots is `annotate()`.
As a rule of thumb, `geoms` are generally useful for highlighting a subset of the data while `annotate()` is useful for adding one or few annotation elements to a plot.

To demonstrate using `annotate()`, let's create some text to add to our plot.
The text is a bit long, so we'll use `stringr::str_wrap()` to automatically add line breaks to it given the number of characters you want per line:

```{r}
trend_text <- str_wrap("Larger engine sizes tend to have lower fuel economy.", width = 30)
```

Then, we add two layers of annotation: one with a label `geom` and the other with a segment geom.
The `x` and `y` aesthetics in both define where the annotation should start, and the `xend` and `yend` aesthetics in the segment annotation define the end location of the segment.

Note also that the segment is styled as an arrow.

`annotate` is a very flexible function that can be used to add a wide variety of annotations to your plots. You can add text, points, lines, and more.

```{r tidy=FALSE}

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  annotate(
    geom = "label",
    x = 3.5,
    y = 38,
    label = trend_text, # the text to display
    hjust = "left",
    color = "red"
  ) +
  annotate(
    geom = "segment",
    x = 3, # start of the line
    y = 35,
    xend = 5, # end of the line
    yend = 25,
    color = "red",
    arrow = arrow(type = "closed") # add an arrow head
  )


```

Annotation is a powerful tool for communicating main takeaways and interesting features of your visualizations.
The only limit is your imagination (and your patience with positioning annotations to be aesthetically pleasing)!

## Scales

The third way you can make your plot better for communication is to adjust the scales.

Scales control how the aesthetic mappings manifest visually.

### Default scales

Normally, `ggplot2` automatically adds scales for you.

For example, when you type:

```{r default-scales, results='hide', fig.show = 'hide'}

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class))
```

`ggplot2` automatically adds default scales behind the scenes:

```{r, fig.show='hide'}

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class)) +
  scale_x_continuous() +
  scale_y_continuous() +
  scale_color_discrete()
```

Note the naming scheme for scales: `scale_` followed by the name of the aesthetic, then `_`, then the name of the scale.
The default scales are named according to the type of variable they align with: continuous, discrete, datetime, or date.
`scale_x_continuous()` puts the numeric values from `displ` on a continuous number line on the x-axis, `scale_color_discrete()` chooses colors for each of the `class` of car, etc.

There are lots of non-default scales which you'll learn about below.

The default scales have been carefully chosen to do a good job for a wide range of inputs.
Nevertheless, you might want to override the defaults for two reasons:

-   You might want to tweak some of the parameters of the default scale.
    This allows you to do things like change the breaks on the axes, or the key labels on the legend.

-   You might want to replace the scale altogether, and use a completely different algorithm.
    Often you can do better than the default because you know more about the data.

### Axis ticks and legend keys

Collectively axes and legends are called **guides**.
Axes are used for x and y aesthetics; legends are used for everything else.

There are two primary arguments that affect the appearance of the ticks on the axes and the keys on the legend: `breaks` and `labels`.
Breaks controls the position of the ticks, or the values associated with the keys.
Labels controls the text label associated with each tick/key.
The most common use of `breaks` is to override the default choice:

```{r}

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(15, 40, by = 5)) 
```

You can use `labels` in the same way (a character vector the same length as `breaks`), but you can also set it to `NULL` to suppress the labels altogether. This can be useful for maps, or for publishing plots where you can't share the absolute numbers.

You can also use `breaks` and `labels` to control the appearance of legends. For discrete scales for categorical variables, `labels` can be a named list of the existing levels names and the desired labels for them.

`scale_color_discrete()` is a discrete scale for color, and `scale_color_manual()` is a manual scale for color.


```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = NULL) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = NULL) +
  scale_color_discrete(labels = c("4" = "4-wheel", "f" = "front", "r" = "rear"))
```

The `labels` argument coupled with labeling functions from the scales package is also useful for formatting numbers as currency, percent, etc.

The following example shows two box plots of price versus cut of diamonds.

The plot on the left shows default labeling with `label_dollar()` from the `scales` package, which adds a dollar sign as well as a thousand separator comma.

The plot on the right adds further customization by dividing dollar values by 1,000 and adding a suffix "K" (for "thousands") as well as adding custom breaks.
Note that `breaks` is in the original scale of the data.

```{r, fig.width = 4}

# Left-# Right
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price, y = cut)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.05) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_dollar()) + ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price, y = cut)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.05) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    labels = label_dollar(scale = 1 / 1000, suffix = "K"),
    breaks = seq(1000, 19000, by = 6000)
  )
```

Another handy label function is `label_percent()`:

```{r, out.width="80%"}

ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, fill = clarity)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Percentage", labels = label_percent())
```


### Legend layout

You will most often use `breaks` and `labels` to tweak the axes.
While they both also work for legends, there are a few other techniques you are more likely to use.

To control the overall position of the legend, you need to use a `theme()` setting.
We'll come back to themes at the end of the chapter, but in brief, they control the non-data parts of the plot.

The theme setting `legend.position` controls where the legend is drawn:

```{r, out.width="80%", fig.width = 10, fig.asp = 0.5}

base <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class))

# the default  right, then left
p1 <- base + theme(legend.position = "right") 

p2 <- base + theme(legend.position = "left")

# then top, then bottom
p3 <- base +
  theme(legend.position = "top") +
  guides(color = guide_legend(nrow = 3)) 

p4 <- base +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  guides(color = guide_legend(nrow = 3))

p1 + p2 + p3 + p4
```

If your plot is short and wide, place the legend at the top or bottom, and if it's tall and narrow, place the legend at the left or right.
You can also use `legend.position = "none"` to suppress the display of the legend altogether.

To control the display of individual legends, use `guides()` along with `guide_legend()` or `guide_colorbar()`.

`guides()` is used to control the appearance of the legend.

`guide_legend()` is used for discrete scales, and `guide_colorbar()` is used for continuous scales.

`guide_legend()` has a number of arguments that allow you to control the appearance of the legend.

The following example shows two important settings: controlling the number of rows the legend uses with `nrow`, and overriding one of the aesthetics to make the points bigger.

This is particularly useful if you have used a low `alpha` to display many points on a plot.
```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  guides(color = guide_legend(nrow = 2, override.aes = list(size = 4)))
```

Note that the name of the argument in `guides()` matches the name of the aesthetic, just like in `labs()`.

### Replacing a scale

Instead of just tweaking the details a little, you can instead replace the scale altogether.
There are two types of scales you're mostly likely to want to switch out: continuous position scales and color scales.

Fortunately, the same principles apply to all the other aesthetics, so once you've mastered position and color, you'll be able to quickly pick up other scale replacements.

### Replacing a scale

Another scale that is frequently customized is color.

The default categorical scale picks colors that are evenly spaced around the color wheel.

Useful alternatives are the RColorBrewer scales which have been hand tuned to work better for people with common types of color blindness.

The two plots below look similar, but there is enough difference in the shades of red and green that the dots on the right can be distinguished even by people with red-green color blindness.[^communication-1]

[^communication-1]: You can use a tool like [SimDaltonism](https://michelf.ca/projects/sim-daltonism/) to simulate color blindness to test these images.
```{r, fig.width = 8}

# default color palette
p1 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv)) 

# RColorBrewer palette
p2 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + geom_point(aes(color = drv)) + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")

p1 + p2
```

Don't forget simpler techniques for improving accessibility.

If there are just a few colors, you can add a redundant shape mapping.

This will also help ensure your plot is interpretable in black and white.

```{r}

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv, shape = drv)) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2")
```

The ColorBrewer scales are documented online at <https://colorbrewer2.org/> and made available in R via the **RColorBrewer** package, by Erich Neuwirth.
Figure \@ref(fig:fig-brewer) shows the complete list of all palettes.

The sequential (top) and diverging (bottom) palettes are particularly useful if your categorical values are ordered, or have a "middle".
This often arises if you've used `cut()` to make a continuous variable into a categorical variable.

```{r fig-brewer, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'All colorBrewer scales.', fig.asp = 2.5}

par(mar = c(0, 3, 0, 0))
RColorBrewer::display.brewer.all()
```

When you have a predefined mapping between values and colors, use `scale_color_manual()`.

For example, if we map presidential party to color, we want to use the standard mapping of red for Republicans and blue for Democrats.

One approach for assigning these colors is using hex color codes:

```{r, tidy=FALSE}
# `row_number()` is a function that returns the row number of a data frame
presidential |> 
  mutate(id = 33 + row_number()) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = start, y = id, color = party)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = end, yend = id)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(Republican = "#E81B23", Democratic = "#00AEF3"))
```

For continuous color, you can use the built-in `scale_color_gradient()` or `scale_fill_gradient()`.

If you have a diverging scale, you can use `scale_color_gradient2()`.

That allows you to give, for example, positive and negative values different colors. That's sometimes also useful if you want to distinguish points above or below the mean.

### Zooming

There are three ways to control the plot limits:

1. Adjusting what data are plotted.
2. Setting the limits in each scale.
3. Setting `xlim` and `ylim` in `coord_cartesian()`.

We'll demonstrate these options in a series of plots. The plot on the left shows the relationship between engine size and fuel efficiency, colored by type of drive train. The plot on the right shows the same variables, but subsets the data that are plotted. Subsetting the data has affected the x and y scales as well as the smooth curve.

1. Adjusting what data are plotted:
```{r, fig.width = 8}

# All data vs. subsetted data
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv)) +
  geom_smooth() + mpg |>
  filter(displ >= 5 & displ <= 6 & hwy >= 10 & hwy <= 25) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv)) +
  geom_smooth()
```

Let's compare these to the two plots below where the plot on the left sets the `limits` on individual scales and the plot on the right sets them in `coord_cartesian()`.

`coord_cartesian()` is generally more useful if you want to zoom in on a region of the plot.

We can see that reducing the limits is equivalent to subsetting the data.
Therefore, to zoom in on a region of the plot, it's generally best to use `coord_cartesian()`. because it doesn't change the fitting of `geom_smooth`.

2. Setting the limits in each scale (left).
3.  Setting `xlim` and `ylim` in `coord_cartesian()` (right).
```{r, fig.width = 8}


# Limiting scale (equivalent to subsetting) vs. zooming in on data
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(5, 6)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(10, 25)) + ggplot(mpg, 
    aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + geom_point(aes(color = drv)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(5, 6), ylim = c(10, 25))
```

On the other hand, setting the `limits` on individual scales is generally more useful if you want to *expand* the limits, e.g., to match scales across different plots.

For example, if we extract two classes of cars and plot them separately, it's difficult to compare the plots because all three scales (the x-axis, the y-axis, and the color aesthetic) have different ranges.

```{r}

suv <- mpg |> filter(class == "suv")
compact <- mpg |> filter(class == "compact")

# suv vs compact
ggplot(suv, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point() + ggplot(compact, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +  
  geom_point()
```

One way to overcome this problem is to share scales across multiple plots, training the scales with the `limits` of the full data.

```{r}

x_scale <- scale_x_continuous(limits = range(mpg$displ))
y_scale <- scale_y_continuous(limits = range(mpg$hwy))
col_scale <- scale_color_discrete(limits = unique(mpg$drv))

# suv vs. compact on the same scale
ggplot(suv, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point() +
  x_scale +
  y_scale +
  col_scale + ggplot(compact, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point() +
  x_scale +
  y_scale +
  col_scale
```

In this particular case, you could have simply used faceting, but this technique is useful more generally, if for instance, you want to spread plots over multiple pages of a report.

## Themes {#sec-themes}

Finally, you can customize the non-data elements of your plot with a theme:

```{r}

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  theme_classic()
```

`ggplot2` includes the eight themes shown in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-themes), with `theme_gray()` as the default.[^communication-2]

Many more are included in add-on packages like **ggthemes** (<https://jrnold.github.io/ggthemes>), by Jeffrey Arnold.

You can also create your own themes, if you are trying to match a particular corporate or journal style.

Many people wonder why the default theme has a gray background. This was a deliberate choice because it puts the data forward while still making the grid lines visible. The white grid lines are visible (which is important because they significantly aid position judgments), but they have little visual impact and we can easily tune them out. The gray background gives the plot a similar typographic color to the text, ensuring that the graphics fit in with the flow of a document without jumping out with a bright white background. Finally, the gray background creates a continuous field of color which ensures that the plot is perceived as a single visual entity.

You can also set default theme to have a white background by using: 

Setting ggplot2 theme
`ggplot2::theme_set(ggplot2::theme_bw())`

```{r fig-themes, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'The eight themes built-in to ggplot2.'}

knitr::include_graphics("images/visualization-themes.png")
```

It's also possible to control individual components of each theme, like the size and color of the font used for the y axis.

We've already seen that `legend.position` controls where the legend is drawn.

There are many other aspects of the legend that can be customized with `theme()`.

For example, in the plot below we change the direction of the legend as well as put a black border around it.

Note that customization of the legend box and plot title elements of the theme are done with `element_*()` functions.

These functions specify the styling of non-data components, e.g., the title text is bolded in the `face` argument of `element_text()` and the legend border color is defined in the `color` argument of `element_rect()`.

The theme elements that control the position of the title and the caption are `plot.title.position` and `plot.caption.position`, respectively.

In the following plot these are set to `"plot"` to indicate these elements are aligned to the entire plot area, instead of the plot panel (the default).

A few other helpful `theme()` components are used to change the placement for format of the title and caption text (this is more what we are used to).

```{r}

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Larger engine sizes tend to have lower fuel economy",
    caption = "Source: https://fueleconomy.gov."
  ) +
  theme(
    legend.position = c(0.6, 0.7),
    legend.direction = "horizontal",
    legend.box.background = element_rect(color = "black"),
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    plot.title.position = "plot",
    plot.caption.position = "plot",
    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0)
  )
```

For an overview of all `theme()` components, see help with `?theme`.

The [ggplot2 book](https://ggplot2-book.org/) is also a great place to go for the full details on theming.

## Layout

So far we talked about how to create and modify a single plot.

What if you have multiple plots you want to lay out in a certain way?

The patchwork package allows you to combine separate plots into the same graphic.

We loaded this package earlier in the chapter.

To place two plots next to each other, you can simply add them to each other.

Note that you first need to create the plots and save them as objects (in the following example they're called `p1` and `p2`).

Then, you place them next to each other with `+`.

```{r, fig.asp = 0.5}

p1 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Plot 1")
p2 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = drv, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(title = "Plot 2")

p1 + p2
```

You can also create complex plot layouts using `|` and `/`. In the following, `|` places the `p1` and `p3` next to each other and `/` moves `p2` to the next line.

```{r, fig.asp = 0.8}

p3 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Plot 3")

(p1 | p3) / p2
```

Additionally, patchwork allows you to collect legends from multiple plots into one common legend, customize the placement of the legend as well as dimensions of the plots, and add a common title, subtitle, caption, etc. to your plots.

Below we create 5 plots:

We have turned off the legends on the box plots and the scatterplot and collected the legends for the density plots at the top of the plot with `& theme(legend.position = "top")`.

Note the use of the `&` operator here instead of the usual `+`.

This is because we're modifying the theme for the patchwork plot as opposed to the individual ggplots.

The legend is placed on top, inside the `guide_area()`.

Finally, we have also customized the heights of the various components of our patchwork -- the guide has a height of 1, the box plots 3, density plots 2, and the faceted scatterplot 4.

Patchwork divides up the area you have allotted for your plot using this scale and places the components accordingly.

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.asp = 1}

p1 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = drv, y = cty, color = drv)) + 
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE) + 
  labs(title = "Plot 1")

p2 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = drv, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE) + 
  labs(title = "Plot 2")

p3 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, color = drv, fill = drv)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + 
  labs(title = "Plot 3")

p4 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy, color = drv, fill = drv)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + 
  labs(title = "Plot 4")

p5 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
  geom_point(show.legend = FALSE) + 
  facet_wrap(~drv) +
  labs(title = "Plot 5")

(
  guide_area() / (p1 + p2) / (p3 + p4) / p5
) +
  plot_annotation(
    title = "City and highway mileage for cars with different drive trains",
    caption = "Source: https://fueleconomy.gov."
  ) +
  plot_layout(
    guides = "collect",
    heights = c(1, 3, 2, 4)
  ) &
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```

## Summary

In this chapter you've learned about adding plot labels such as title, subtitle, caption as well as modifying default axis labels, using annotation to add informational text to your plot or to highlight specific data points, customizing the axis scales, and changing the theme of your plot.
You've also learned about combining multiple plots in a single graph using both simple and complex plot layouts.

While you've so far learned about how to make many different types of plots and how to customize them using a variety of techniques, we've barely scratched the surface of what you can create with `ggplot2`.

If you want to get a comprehensive understanding of `ggplot2`, we recommend reading the book, [*ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis*](https://ggplot2-book.org).

Other useful resources are the [*R Graphics Cookbook*](https://r-graphics.org) by Winston Chang and [*Fundamentals of Data Visualization*](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/) by Claus Wilke.
