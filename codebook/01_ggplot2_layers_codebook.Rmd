## Introduction

ggplot2 is based on the grammar of graphics, the idea that you can build every graph from the same components: a data set, a coordinate system, and geoms—visual marks that represent data points. In this chapter, you'll expand on your `ggplot2` foundation. We'll start with a deeper dive into aesthetic mappings, geometric objects, and facets. Then, you will learn about statistical transformations `ggplot2` makes under the hood when creating a plot. These transformations are used to calculate new values to plot, such as the heights of bars in a bar plot or medians in a box plot. You will also learn about  position adjustments, which modify how `geoms` are displayed in your plots.

We will not cover every single function and option for each of these layers, but we will walk you through the most important and commonly used functionality provided by `ggplot2` as well as introduce you to packages that extend `ggplot2`.

### Prerequisites

Load the necessary packages into your session:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork)
library(scales)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggrepel)
```


## Aesthetic mappings

The `mpg` data frame is bundled with the ggplot2 package and contains
`r nrow(mpg)` observations on `r mpg |> distinct(model) |> nrow()` car
models from [fueleconomy.gov](https://fueleconomy.gov/). 

```{r include = F}

?mpg

names(mpg)

```

Among the variables in `mpg` are:

1. `displ`: A car's engine size (displacement), in liters. A numerical variable.

2. `hwy`: A car's fuel efficiency on the highway, in miles per gallon
    (mpg). A car with a low fuel efficiency consumes more fuel than a
    car with a high fuel efficiency when they travel the same distance.
    A numerical variable.

3. `class`: Type of car. A categorical variable.

Let's start by visualizing the relationship between `displ` and `hwy`
for various `classes` of cars. We can do this with a scatterplot where
the numerical variables are mapped to the `x` and `y` aesthetics and the
categorical variable is mapped to an aesthetic like `color` or `shape`

```{r fig.width = 10, fig.asp = 0.4, fig.show = 'hold'}
library(patchwork)
(ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) +
  geom_point()) +
(ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class)) + 
  geom_point()) + 
  plot_layout(ncol = 2)
```

Note the use of `plot_layout` from the `patchwork` package to layout the plots in two rows.

`patchwork` also allows use of mathematical symbols to layout `ggplots`:

Use `+` to plot them side-by-side:

```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.asp = 0.4}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + 
  ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class)) + geom_point() 
```

Use '/' to plot them in one column:

```{r fig.height = 10, fig.width = 7, out.width = "100%"}

(ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point())/ 
  (ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class)) + geom_point())
```

Notice that parentheses are required for this operation unless you first save the plots:

```{r fig.height = 10}

p1 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point()

p2 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class)) + geom_point()

p1/p2

```

When `class` is mapped to `shape`, we get two warnings:

> 1: The shape palette can deal with a maximum of 6 discrete values because more than 6 becomes difficult to discriminate; you have 7.
> Consider specifying shapes manually if you must have them.
>
> 2: Removed 62 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).

Since `ggplot2` will only use six shapes at a time, by default, additional groups will go unplotted when you use the shape aesthetic.
The second warning is related -- there are 62 SUVs in the dataset and they're not plotted.

Similarly, we can map `class` to `size` or `alpha` aesthetics as well, which control the size and the transparency of the points, respectively.

```{r fig.width = 5}

# class mapped to size
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = class)) +
  geom_point() 

# class mapped to alpha
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, alpha = class)) +
  geom_point() 
```

Both of these produce warnings as well:

> Using size for a discrete variable is not advised.
> Using alpha for a discrete variable is not advised.

Mapping an unordered discrete (categorical) variable (`class`) to an ordered aesthetic (`size` or `alpha`) is generally not a good idea because it implies a ranking that does not in fact exist.

Once you map an aesthetic, `ggplot2` takes care of the rest. It selects a reasonable **scale** to use with the aesthetic, and it constructs a **legend** that explains the mapping between levels and values. For x and y aesthetics, `ggplot2` does not create a legend, but it creates an axis line with tick marks and a label. The axis line provides the same information as a legend; it explains the mapping between locations and values.

You can also set the visual properties of your `geom` manually as an argument of your `geom` function (*outside* of `aes()`) instead of relying on a variable mapping to determine the appearance. For example, we can make all of the points in our plot blue:

```{r}

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(color = "blue") 
```

Here, the **color** doesn't convey information about a variable, but only changes the appearance of the plot.
You'll need to pick a value that makes sense for that aesthetic:

-   The name of a color as a character string, e.g., `color = "blue"`
-   The size of a point in mm, e.g., `size = 1`
-   The shape of a point as a number, e.g, `shape = 1`, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-shapes)


```{r fig-shapes, echo=FALSE, fig.asp=0.364, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Mapping between shapes and their numeric codes.'}

shapes <- tibble(
  shape = c(0, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 6:19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24),
  x = (0:24 %/% 5) / 2,
  y = (-(0:24 %% 5)) / 4
)
ggplot(shapes, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point(aes(shape = shape), size = 5, fill = "red") +
  geom_text(aes(label = shape), hjust = 0, nudge_x = 0.15) +
  scale_shape_identity() +
  expand_limits(x = 4.1) +
  scale_x_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL) + 
  scale_y_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL, limits = c(-1.2, 0.2)) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1/2.75)
```

So far we have discussed aesthetics that we can map or set in a scatterplot, when using a point `geom`. You can learn more about all possible aesthetic mappings in the aesthetic specifications vignette at <https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2-specs.html>.

The specific aesthetics you can use for a plot depend on the `geom` you use to represent the data.

### Where do aesthetics go in ggplot2?

Think of aesthetics in ggplot2 like this:

```
          +-----------------------------+
          | ggplot(aes(...))            |
          |                             |
          |  ✅ Variable mappings       |
          |     (from your data)        |
          |     e.g. aes(x = displ,     |
          |              y = hwy,       |
          |              color = class) |
          |                             |
          |  ❌ NOT for constants!      |
          +-----------------------------+

                 |
                 v
          +-----------------------------+
          | geom_point(aes(...))        |
          |                             |
          |  ✅ Local variable mappings |
          |     (override or add)       |
          |     e.g. aes(shape = drv)   |
          +-----------------------------+

                 |
                 v
          +-----------------------------+
          | geom_point(..., outside aes)|
          |                             |
          |  ✅ Fixed constants         |
          |     (same for all points)   |
          |     e.g. color = "pink",    |
          |          shape = 24,        |
          |          size = 3           |
          +-----------------------------+
```

#### Examples

- **Variable mapping (inside aes)**  
```{r}
  ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, color = class)) +
    geom_point()
```

- **Fixed constants (outside aes)**  
```{r}
  ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
    geom_point(color = "pink", shape = 24, size = 3)
```
:::
.

If you wanted to use the numerical shapes the code would be this:
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)

# top: color mapping, no issue
p1 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, color = class)) +
  geom_point(size = 2.5)

# bottom: shape mapping, override default 6-shape limit
p2 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, shape = class)) +
  geom_point(size = 2.5) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6))  # 7 shapes

p1 / p2
```

So far we have discussed aesthetics that we can map or set in a scatterplot, when using a point `geom`. You can learn more about all possible aesthetic mappings in the aesthetic specifications vignette at <https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2-specs.html>.

In the next section we dive deeper into `geoms`.

### 2.2.1 Exercises {.unnumbered}

1. Create a scatterplot of `hwy` vs. `displ` where the points are pink filled in triangles. +2pts

```{r}
# Your answer here

```

2. Why did the following code not result in a plot with blue points? +2pts

```{r}

ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
```

**Your answer here:**


3. What does the `stroke` aesthetic do? What shapes does it work with? (Hint: use `?geom_point`) +2pts

**Your answer here:**

```{r}
# Your code here

```

4. What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable name, like `aes(color = displ < 5)`? Try it by adding color to the following plot: +2pts

```{r}

ggplot(mpg) + geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

```

**Your answer here:**

```{r}
# Your code here

```

## Geometric objects

How are these two plots similar?

```{r echo=FALSE}


p1 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +  geom_point() 

p2 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + geom_smooth()

p1 + p2
```

Both plots contain the same x variable, the same y variable, and both describe the same data. But the plots are not identical. Each plot uses a different geometric object, `geom`, to represent the data. The first plot uses the point `geom`, and the plot on the second uses the smooth `geom`, a smooth line fitted to the data.

To change the `geom` in your plot, change the `geom` function that you add to `ggplot()`. For instance, to make the plots above, you can use the following code:

```{r fig.width = 6}
# point
p1 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + geom_point() 

# smooth
p2 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + geom_smooth()

p1 + p2
```

Every `geom` function in ggplot2 takes a `mapping` argument, either defined locally in the `geom` layer or globally in the `ggplot()` layer.

However, not every aesthetic works with every `geom`. You could set the shape of a point, but you couldn't set the "shape" of a line. If you try, ggplot2 will silently ignore that aesthetic mapping. On the other hand, you *could* set the `linetype` of a line.

`geom_smooth()` will draw a different line, with a different `linetype`, for each unique value of the variable that you map to `linetype`.


```{r fig.width = 6, fig.show = 'hold'}

# Top
p1 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = drv)) + 
  geom_smooth()

# Bottom
p2 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, linetype = drv)) + 
  geom_smooth()

p1/p2
```

Here, `geom_smooth()` separates the cars into three lines based on their `drv` value, which describes a car's drive train.

One line describes all of the points that have a `4` value, one line describes all of the points that have an `f` value, and one line describes all of the points that have an `r` value.

Here, `4` stands for four-wheel drive, `f` for front-wheel drive, and `r` for rear-wheel drive.

**Notice there is no legend for the first plot because geometric smooth does not have a shape aesthetic.**

If this sounds strange, we can make it clearer by overlaying the lines on top of the raw data and then coloring everything according to `drv`.

```{r fig.width = 6}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(aes(linetype = drv))

```

Notice that this plot contains two `geoms` in the same graph.

You can use the same idea to specify different `data` for each layer.
Here, we use red points as well as open circles to highlight two-seater cars.
The local data argument in `geom_point()` overrides the global data argument in `ggplot()` for that layer only.

```{r}

g <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_point(data = mpg |> filter(class == '2seater'),
             color = "red")

g + geom_point(
  data = mpg |> filter(class == '2seater'),
  shape = "triangle open",
  size = 3,
  color = "red"
)
```

`geoms` are the fundamental building blocks of `ggplot2`. You can completely transform the look of your plot by changing its geom, and different `geoms` can reveal different features of your data. For example, the histogram and density plot below reveal that the distribution of highway mileage is bimodal and right skewed while the boxplot reveals two potential outliers.

```{r fig.width = 6}
 
# histogram
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 2)

# density
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy)) + geom_density()

# boxplot
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy)) + geom_boxplot()
```

`ggplot2` provides more than 40 `geoms` but these don't cover all possible plots one could make. If you need a different `geom`, we recommend looking into extension packages first to see if someone else has already implemented it (see <https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/> for a sampling).

For example, the **ggridges** package ([https://wilkelab.org/ggridges](https://wilkelab.org/ggridges/){.uri}) is useful for making ridgeline plots, which can be useful for visualizing the density of a numerical variable for different levels of a categorical variable.

In the following plot not only did we use a new `geom` (`geom_density_ridges()`), but we have also mapped the same variable to multiple aesthetics (`drv` to `y`, `fill`, and `color`) as well as set an aesthetic (`alpha = 0.5`) to make the density curves transparent.

```{r fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6}

library(ggridges)

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy, y = drv, fill = drv, color = drv)) +
  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.5, show.legend = FALSE)
```

The best place to get a comprehensive overview of all of the `geoms` `ggplot2` offers, as well as all functions in the package, is the reference page: <https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference>.
To learn more about any single `geom`, use the help (e.g., `?geom_smooth`).

### 2.3.1 Exercises {.unnumbered}

1. 
    a) What `geom` would you use to draw a line chart? A boxplot? A histogram? An area chart? +4pts

**Your answer here:**


1.
    b) Use the following ggplot to create 4 plots, `geom_line()`, `geom_boxplot()`, `geom_point()` and `geom_area()`. Include a title specifying the geometry for each. +4pts

```{r}
df <- data.frame(
  x = c(3, 1, 5), 
  y = c(2, 4, 6), 
  label = c("a","b","c"))

p <- ggplot(df, aes(x, y, label = label))  
  
```

```{r}
# Your code here

```

2. Earlier in this chapter we used `show.legend` without explaining it:

```{r}

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(color = drv), show.legend = FALSE)
```

What does `show.legend = FALSE` do here? What happens if you remove it? Try it. +2pts

**Your answer here:**

```{r}
# Your code here

```

3. What does the `se` argument to `geom_smooth()` do? +2pts

**Your answer here:**


4. Recreate the R code necessary to generate and save the following graph and arrange them in a figure with 2 columns. Note that wherever a categorical variable is used in the plot, it's `drv`. Use the mathematical notation in one, and the function from `patchwork`, `plot_layout` in another for laying out the plot. +6pts

```{r 6-plots, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = 'Six plots arranged in two columns'}

knitr::include_graphics("images/6-plots.png")
```

```{r}
# Your code here

```

## Facets

Another way, which is particularly useful for categorical variables, is
to split your plot into **facets**, subplots that each display one
subset of the data.

To facet your plot by a single variable, use `facet_wrap()`. The first
argument of `facet_wrap()` is a formula, which you create with `~`
followed by a variable name. The variable that you pass to
`facet_wrap()` should be categorical.

Here "formula" is the name of the thing created by `~`, not a synonym
for "equation".
```{r fig.width = 7}

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(~cyl)
```


To facet your plot with the combination of two variables, switch from
`facet_wrap()` to `facet_grid()`. The first argument of `facet_grid()`
is also a formula, but now it's a double sided formula: `rows ~ cols`.

```{r fig.width = 6}

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)
```

The first argument in `facet_grid` determines the faceting by row, the second by column.
By default each of the facets share the same scale and range for x and y axes.

This is useful when you want to compare data across facets but it can be limiting when you want to visualize the relationship within each facet better.

Setting the `scales` argument in a faceting function to `"free"` will allow for different axis scales across both rows and columns, `"free_x"` will allow for different scales across rows, and `"free_y"` will allow for different scales across columns.

```{r fig.width = 6}

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl, scales = "free_y")
```

Modifying facet label appearance:

```{r fig.width = 5}

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl) +
  theme(
    strip.text.x = element_text(
      size = 12,
      face = "bold",
      colour = "blue",
      angle = 75
    ),
    strip.text.y = element_text(
      size = 14,
      face = "bold",
      colour = "red"
    ),
    strip.background = element_rect(
      colour = "navy",
      fill = "#CCCCFF",
      linewidth  = 2
    )
  )
```

  facet_grid(drv ~ .)
```

```{r}
# Your code here

```

## Statistical transformations

Consider a basic bar chart, drawn with `geom_bar()` or `geom_col()`. The
following chart displays the total number of diamonds in the `diamonds`
dataset, grouped by `cut`. The `diamonds` dataset is in the `ggplot2`
package and contains information on \~54,000 diamonds, including the
`price`, `carat`, `color`, `clarity`, and `cut` of each diamond. The
chart shows that more diamonds are available with high quality cuts than
with low quality cuts.

```{r fig.width = 6}

ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut)) + 
  geom_bar()
```


On the x-axis, the chart displays `cut`, a variable from `diamonds`. On
the y-axis, it displays count, but count is not a variable in
`diamonds`! Where does count come from? Many graphs, like scatterplots,
plot the raw values of your dataset. Other graphs, like bar charts,
calculate new values to plot:

-   Bar charts, histograms, and frequency polygons bin your data and
    then plot bin counts, the number of points that fall in each bin.

-   Smoothers fit a model to your data and then plot predictions from
    the model.

-   Boxplots compute the five-number summary of the distribution and
    then display that summary as a specially formatted box.

The algorithm used to calculate new values for a graph is called a
**stat**, short for statistical transformation.

The following figure shows how this process works with `geom_bar()`. When creating a bar chart we first start with the raw data, then aggregate it to count the number of observations in each bar, and finally map those computed variables to plot aesthetics:
```{r fig-vis-stat-bar, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/visualization-stat-bar.png")
```

You can learn which stat a `geom` uses by inspecting the default value for
the `stat` argument. For example, `?geom_bar` shows that the default
value for `stat` is "count", which means that `geom_bar()` uses
`stat_count()`. `stat_count()` is documented on the same page as
`geom_bar()`. If you scroll down, the section called "Computed
variables" explains that it computes two new variables: `count` and
`prop`.

Every `geom` has a default stat; and every stat has a default `geom`. This
means that you can typically use `geoms` without worrying about the
underlying statistical transformation. However, there are three reasons
why you might need to use a stat explicitly:

1. You might want to override the default stat. In the code below, we
    change the stat of `geom_bar()` from count (the default) to
    identity.This lets us map the height of the bars to the raw values
    of a y variable. Here, we use `stat = "identity"` to plot the raw because we want to plot the raw values of the y variable, not the count of the y variable.

```{r fig.width = 6}

diamonds |>
  count(cut) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = cut, y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

2. You might want to override the default `mapping` from transformed variables to aesthetics. For example, you might want to display a bar chart of proportions, rather than counts:

```{r fig.width = 5}

ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, y = after_stat(prop), group = 1)) +
  geom_bar()
```
The prop variable is a computed value provided by the stat = "count" transformation (the default for `geom_bar`).

To find the possible variables that can be computed by the stat, look for the section titled "computed variables" in the help for `geom_bar()`.

`ggplot2` provides more than 20 stats for you to use.
Each stat is a function, so you can get help in the usual way, e.g., `?stat_bin`.

3. 
    a) In our proportion bar chart, we needed to set `group = 1`. Why? In other words, what is the problem with these two graphs? Replot the two plots below using a `group` variable so that it plots correctly. +2pts

  x = cut, fill = color, y = after_stat(prop)
  )) +

## Position adjustments

There's one more piece of magic associated with bar charts.
You can color a bar chart using either the `color` aesthetic, or, more usefully, the `fill` aesthetic:

```{r fig.width = 5}
# Top
p1 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = drv, color = drv)) + 
  geom_bar()

# Bottom
p2 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = drv, fill = drv)) + 
  geom_bar()

p1/p2
```

Note what happens if you map the fill aesthetic to another variable, like `class`: the bars are automatically stacked.
Each colored rectangle represents a combination of `drv` and `class`.

```{r fig.width = 5}

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = drv, fill = class)) + 
  geom_bar()
```

The stacking is performed automatically using the **position adjustment** specified by the `position` argument.
If you don't want a stacked bar chart, you can use one of three other options: `"identity"`, `"dodge"` or `"fill"`.

The identity position adjustment is more useful for 2d `geoms`, like points, where it is the default.

-   `position = "fill"` works like stacking, but makes each set of stacked bars the same height.
    This makes it easier to compare proportions across groups.

-   `position = "dodge"` places overlapping objects directly *beside* one another.
    This makes it easier to compare individual values.

```{r fig.width = 5}


p1 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = drv, fill = class)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") + ggtitle("Position = fill")


p2 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = drv, fill = class)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") + ggtitle("Position = dodge")

p1/p2
```

There's one other type of adjustment that's not useful for bar charts,
but can be very useful for scatterplots. Recall our first scatterplot.
Did you notice that the plot displays only 126 points, even though there
are 234 observations in the dataset?

```{r fig.width = 5, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point()
```

The underlying values of `hwy` and `displ` are rounded so the points
appear on a grid and many points overlap each other. This problem is
known as **overplotting**. This arrangement makes it difficult to see
the distribution of the data. Are the data points spread equally
throughout the graph, or is there one special combination of `hwy` and
`displ` that contains 109 values?

You can avoid this gridding by setting the position adjustment to
"jitter". `position = "jitter"` adds a small amount of random noise to
each point. This spreads the points out because no two points are likely
to receive the same amount of random noise.

```{r fig.width = 5}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(position = "jitter")
```

Adding randomness seems like a strange way to improve your plot, but while it makes your graph less accurate at small scales, it makes your graph *more* revealing at large scales.
Because this is such a useful operation, `ggplot2` comes with a shorthand for `geom_point(position = "jitter")`: `geom_jitter()`.

To learn more about a position adjustment, look up the help page associated with each adjustment: `?position_dodge`, `?position_fill`, `?position_identity`, `?position_jitter`, and `?position_stack`.

## Grammar of graphics

We can expand on the graphing template you've learned by adding position adjustments, stats, coordinate systems, and faceting:

```         
ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(
     mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>),
     stat = <STAT>, 
     position = <POSITION>
  ) +
  <COORDINATE_FUNCTION> +
  <FACET_FUNCTION>
```

Our new template takes seven parameters, the bracketed words that appear
in the template. In practice, you rarely need to supply all seven
parameters to make a graph because `ggplot2` will provide useful defaults
for everything except the data, the mappings, and the `geom` function.

The seven parameters in the template compose the grammar of graphics, a
formal system for building plots. The grammar of graphics is based on
the insight that you can uniquely describe *any* plot as a combination
of a dataset, a `geom`, a set of mappings, a stat, a position adjustment,
a coordinate system, a faceting scheme, and a theme.

To see how this works, consider how you could build a basic plot from
scratch: you could start with a dataset and then transform it into the
information that you want to display (with a stat). Next, you could
choose a geometric object to represent each observation in the
transformed data. You could then use the aesthetic properties of the
`geoms` to represent variables in the data. You would map the values of
each variable to the levels of an aesthetic. These steps are illustrated
in \@ref(fig:visualization-grammar). You'd then select a coordinate
system to place the `geoms` into, using the location of the objects (which
is itself an aesthetic property) to display the values of the x and y
variables.

```{r visualization-grammar, echo = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("images/visualization-grammar.png")
```

At this point, you would have a complete graph, but you could further adjust the positions of the `geoms` within the coordinate system (a position adjustment) or split the graph into subplots (faceting).
You could also extend the plot by adding one or more additional layers, where each additional layer uses a dataset, a `geom`, a set of mappings, a stat, and a position adjustment.

You could use this method to build *any* plot that you imagine.
In other words, you can use the code template that you've learned in this chapter to build hundreds of thousands of unique plots.

If you'd like to learn more about the theoretical underpinnings of `ggplot2`, you might enjoy reading "[The Layered Grammar of Graphics](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf)", the scientific paper that describes the theory of `ggplot2` in detail.

## Summary

In this chapter you learned about the layered grammar of graphics starting with aesthetics and geometries to build a simple plot, facets for splitting the plot into subsets, statistics for understanding how `geoms` are calculated, position adjustments for controlling the fine details of position when `geoms` might otherwise overlap, and coordinate systems which allow you to fundamentally change what `x` and `y` mean.

Two very useful resources for getting an overview of the complete `ggplot2` functionality are the `ggplot2` cheatsheet (which you can find at <https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets>) and the `ggplot2`
