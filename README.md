# r4ds-ggplot2 (R for data science)

This is a repository for the [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) book club at the 
University of British Columbia. We are currently working through the ggplot2 chapter.

R for Data Science is a great book for learning how to use R for data analysis.
The book is available online for free, and is also available in print. The book is written by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund.
